Unlike other medical diagnoses, a professional reviews the patient's symptom history against criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The doctor then judges the severity of the symptoms based on previous psychiatric cases (NAMI, 2020). These diagnostics can take 30 minutes to hours over weeks, depending on the clinic. This immense gap is caused by different depths in diagnosis. For example, a 30-minute diagnosis relies on the patient's self-reported symptom history. Whereas, months worth of clinical visits consisting of the psychiatric analysis of patents' behaviors and feelings yield more accurate reports of metal history.
