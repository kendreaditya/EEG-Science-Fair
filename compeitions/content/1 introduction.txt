Psychological misdiagnosis is a preventable adverse effect of medical care, despite its severity. Mental illness like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) around 50% of patients who receive a diagnosis do not have MDD(Mojtabai, 2013). The majority of the misdiagnosis occurs because of the lack of information present during the diagnostics period. Clinicians must rely solely on patient-reported symptoms for the diagnosis. Thus, without accurate patient history, misdiagnosis of mental illness are inclined to arise. However, with Electroencephalographs (EEGs) it is possible to deduce information that otherwise would not be possible to drive. An Electroencephalography is a method that measures the electrical activity of different parts of the brain via non-invasive electrodes that are placed on the scalp. Each electrode measures the voltage fluctuations which are created by the neurons in the brain. These voltage signals are composed of many signals within the range of 1-20 Hz, which include multiple frequency bands: Delta (0<4), Theta (4-7), Alpha (8-15), Beta (16-31), and Gamma (32<). Each band conveys different types of cognitive states.
